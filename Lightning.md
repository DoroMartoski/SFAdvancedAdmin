#### Record level Access in Salesforce

##### Record level access in Salesforce can be managed through: 
* Org-wide defaults
* Role hierichies
* Sharing rules
* Manual sharing

**Feed tracking** : you can track fields on User, Custom and External objects and the most standard objects.
If feed tracking is enabled for certain objects, some of that object's fields are tracked by default - e.g account name, account owner, case owner etc.
**Users must have access permission to a record to see changes to that record in their feed as sharing rules and field level security determines visibility of record changes in chatter feeds.**
