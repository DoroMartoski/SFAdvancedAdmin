**Leads**: people and companies identifies as potential customers
Advantages of Leads:
* better tracking and reporting on and target marketing campaigns to prospective customers

After qualifying a lead, you can convert the lead into an opportunity.
* When you convert a lead, Salesforce uses the information stored in the lead record to create a business account, a contact, and an opportunity.
* If you’ve enabled person accounts and the lead record didn’t include a company name, the lead is converted into a person account and an opportunity.

**Opportunities**: deals in progress.
opportunities can be created for existing accounts or by converting a qualified lead.
Progress opportunities through stages such as: Prospecting, Proposal/Price Quote, Negotiation/Review, Closed/Won, Closed/Lost.
Each opportunity stage is associated with a Probability of winning the deal.
You can set up separate sales processes for each **type of sale** that reps make.

**Contact Roles on Opportunities**:
* tells you which contacts you’re dealing with and how each contact is related to the opportunity. 
* You can also use contact roles to link contacts from other accounts to the opportunity.

**Opportunity Splits**:
* whereas account team members can be expected to form a long-term relationship with a customer, an opportunity team is a temporary group.
* Opportunity team members have special visibility into an opportunity, such as related Chatter posts
* If you’re the opportunity owner or above the owner in the role hierarchy, you can add and adjust splits on an opportunity.
* There are two kinds of splits. 
  * **Revenue splits**: **for crediting team members who are directly responsible for the revenue on an opportunity**. Revenue splits always total 100% of the opportunity amount.
  * **Overlay Split**: An overlay split gives you a way to credit supporting team members. It can total any percentage of the opportunity amount, including a percentage over 100%, and it doesn’t count toward the revenue split on the same opportunity.
* **Team members working on an opportunity can roll their individual sales credits into forecasts and into quota and pipeline reports for the entire team.** 
* To generate reports, use one of the following report types.
  * Split Opportunities
  * Split Opportunities with Products
  * Split Opportunities with Products and Schedules

* Use the Path to update the record’s status by clicking Mark Status as Complete to move the record to the next step on the path
